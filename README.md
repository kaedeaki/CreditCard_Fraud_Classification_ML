**Name of project**: Credit Card Fraud Detection Classification  
**Aim**: Build a classification model to predict the Fraud Detection of Credit Card.  
**Language**: Python  
**Solution**: Used various methods such as XG Boost, logistic regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree.  
**Results**: The best model is XB Boost. The performance is Recall: 98%, Precision: 100%, F-1 Score: 99%, and Accuracy: 99%. The principal component V14 has a high impact on the chance of fraud. Predicting Fraud Detection can be a useful tool in many real world scenarios such as risk assessment, credit scoring, risk analysis of investors, and regulatory compliance.
